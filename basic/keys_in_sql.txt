KEYS in SQL

1. SUPER key : A super key is a set of one or more attributes (columns), which can uniquely identify a row in a table.
    - Candidate keys are selected from the set of super keys, the only thing we take care while selecting 
        candidate key is: 
        It should not have any redundant attribute.

2. CANDIDATE key : Mnimal set of super key which can identify a tuple.
    - eg. for student name , class , id
    - Can be siple key or composite key.
    - There can be more than 1 candidate key in a relation.
    - Always candidate key is also a super key but vise versa is not true.

3. PRIMARY key : An attribute is chosen from available candidate key to uniquely identify a record.
    - Primary key must be cobination of not null and unique key constraints.

4. ALTRNATE key : All the candidate key except for the primary key are alternae key.

5. FOREIGN key : To establish connection between 2 tables we need foreign key.
    - To become a foreign key the key must be a primary key in other table;
    - It can be null or not unique;

6. COMPOSITE KEY: COMPOSITE KEY is a combination of two or more columns that uniquely identify rows in a table.
    The combination of columns guarantees uniqueness, though individually uniqueness is not guaranteed. 
    Hence, they are combined to uniquely identify records in a table.
    - It can be a Candidate key, Primary key.

7. COMPOUND KEY: COMPOUND KEY has two or more attributes that allow you to uniquely recognize a specific record. 
    It is possible that each column may not be unique by itself within the database. However,
    when combined with the other column or columns the combination of composite keys become unique.
    The purpose of the compound key in database is to uniquely identify each record in the table.

NOTE : The difference between compound and the composite key is that any part of the compound key can be a foreign key,
    but the composite key may or maybe not a part of the foreign key.

8. Unique Key
A unique key is a set of one or more fields/columns of a table that uniquely identify a record in a database table. 
    - It is like Primary key but it can accept only one null value.
    - It can not accept duplicate value.
