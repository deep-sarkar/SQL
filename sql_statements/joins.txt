JOINS
 -The Joins clause is used to combine records from two or more tables in a database. 
    A JOIN is a means for combining fields from two tables by using values common to each.

1. CROSS/CARTESIAN join:
    - Syntax:
        SELECT ... FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2 ...
    - A CROSS JOIN matches every row of the first table with every row of the second table.
    - If table A contains m number of record and b contains n number of record then joined table will contain
        m*n records.
    - The column number in resultant will be sum of number of column for table A and table B.

2. INNER join
    - Syntax:
        SELECT table1.column1, table2.column2...
        FROM table1
        INNER JOIN table2
        ON table1.common_filed = table2.common_field;
    - A INNER JOIN creates a new result table by combining column values of two tables 
        (table1 and table2) based upon the join-condition.
    - The query compares each row of table1 with each row of table2 to find all pairs of rows, 
        which satisfy the join-condition.
    - When the join-condition. is satisfied, column values for each matched pair of rows of 
        table1 and table2 are combined into a result row.

3. OUTER JOIN
    It is extension of INNER join. There are 3 types of outer Joins.
    A. LEFT OUTER JOIN
        - Syntax:
            SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT OUTER JOIN table2 ON conditional_expression ...
        - In case of LEFT OUTER JOIN, an inner join is performed first. Then, for each row in table T1 
        that does not satisfy the join condition with any row in table T2, a joined row is added with null values in 
        columns of T2. Thus, the joined table always has at least one row for each row in T1.

    B. RIGHT OUTER JOIN
    C. FULL OUTER JOIN
