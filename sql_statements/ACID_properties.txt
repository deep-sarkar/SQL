ACID in rdbms
Conceptual properties for a transaction.

1. Aomicity
    => Either all or none
        - If in a transaction, if it fails at any step, we will go for rollback before commit 
            so that there shouldn't be any data loss.
        - By this we can conclude we will commit either for complete transaction not for a part of transaction.
        - A failed transaction cant be resumed, it will be restart from first step.

2. Consistancy
    => Before transaction start and after transaction complete the sum of perticular attribute(money) should be same.

3. Isolation
    => Try to change all parallel transaction into searies of transaction so tha it should be consistance.

4. Durability
